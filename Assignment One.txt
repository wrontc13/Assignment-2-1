Class is a template definition of the methods and variables in a particular kind of object. 

Inheritance is when an object or class is based on another object or class using the same implementation specifying implementation to maintain the same behavior.

Polymorphism refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their date type or class. 

Encapsulation is the inclusion within a program object of all the resources needed for the object to function. 

Abstraction is when a programmer hides all but the relevant date about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.
